Reputation and Its Risks

A company's overall reputation is a function of its reputation among its various stakeholders in specific categories.

A strong positive reputation among stakeholders across multiple categories will result in a strong positive reputation for the company overall.

Effectively managing reputational risk involves five steps: assessing your company's reputation among stakeholders, evaluating your company's real character, closing reputation-reality gaps, monitoring changing beliefs and expectations, and putting a senior executive below the CEO in charge.

Three questions need to be addressed: What is the company's reputation in each area? Why? How do these reputations compare with those of the firm's peers?

Since the reputation of a company is a function of others' reputations in its industry and the relative reputation of the industry overall, having the complete context is essential for assessing volume and prominence of coverage, topics of interest, and whether the view is positive or negative.

Even if a small company has a very strong reputation among a small group of core investors or customers, it runs a high risk of suffering considerable damage to its reputation if its media coverage is below the awareness threshold when a crisis hits.

Second, executives tend to believe that their company has a good reputation if there is no indication that it is bad, when in fact the company has no reputation in that area.
