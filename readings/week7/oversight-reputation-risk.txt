Board Perspectives: Risk Oversight Board Oversight of Reputation Risk Issue 83 Reputation risk is the current and prospective impact on earnings and enterprise value arising from negative stakeholder opinion.

The board's oversight of risk is important because effective identification and management of risk can reveal major threats to reputation and ensure that they are reduced to an acceptable level.

Integration of risk into strategy-setting and business planning: The board must ensure that risk is not an afterthought to strategy-setting and business planning.

Integrating risk with these core management processes makes risk a relevant factor at the decision-making table, facilitates a strategic view to undertaking risk and intersects risk management with performance management.

As a crisis event is a severe manifestation of risk, crisis management preparation is a natural follow-on to risk assessment, particularly for high-impact risks with high velocity, high persistence and low response readiness.

Reputation risk management is inextricably linked to the risk management and crisis management disciplines, as well as to the organization's alignment of strategy and culture and its commitment to quality and operational excellence.
